> This mod is an unofficial remastered version of Forge from [Ship In A Bottle](https://modrinth.com/mod/vs-ship-in-a-bottle) and is currently in Alpha Beta, please do not submit issues with this mod to Ship in a Bottle.

Note:

- This mod teleports the physics to a great distance when the player uses the mod's empty bottle on the Valkyrie's physics, and then teleports back when the player uses the Bottle Boat.

- If your bottle_with_ship in item form is lost, you'll need to use the following two commands to get your physical structure back up.
```
/vmod teleport <ShipName> <x> <y> <z> (0,0,0)
```
```
/vs set-static <ShipName> false
```
